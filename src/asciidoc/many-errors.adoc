[.lead]
This document deliberately contains several (semantic) errors
in the asciidoc source. It shall be used to test the htmlSanityChecker.


[[first]]
== Wrong Cross References

=== Existing and Nonexisting Targets


[source,asciidoc]
.Wrong Cross References
----
[[first]]
== Wrong Cross References

=== Existing and Nonexisting Targets

*Correct link*: <<first, goto first>> heading. // <1>

*Wrong (non-existing) cross-reference*: points to <<nowhere>> // <2>
----

<1> *Correct link*: <<first, goto first>> heading.

<2> *Wrong (non-existing) cross-reference*: points to <<nowhere>>
(target 'nowhere' does not exist)


[[only-legal]]
=== Illegal Characters in Cross Reference

[source,asciidoc]
.Illegal Characters in Cross Reference
----
It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>, // <1>
like " " (blank) in links.

Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>> // <2>
----

It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>,
like " " (blank) in links.

<1> blank in link source (betwenn "illegal" and "characters")

<2> Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>>


[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions
This heading has the id "duplicateId"...

[[duplicateId]]
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicateId" ...


[source, asciidoc]
----
[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicateId, this link>> // <1>
does not know where to take you....


[[duplicateId]]          // <2>
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicate" id...

----

<1> a link to a named HTML element
<2> the duplicate definition of the link target.

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicateId, this link>> does not know where to take you....




== Images

Existing image::
image:aim42-logo.png[aim-logo]

Missing image::
image:nonexisting-image.png[this image deliberately missing]

Missing alt-attribute::
++++
<img src="images/aim42-logo.png" width="100">
++++


== Local Resources
The term "Local Resources" refers to non-image files referenced
from html - most often other html files, stylesheets or JavaScript.

kbd:[htmlSC] currently checks only those local resources which are
referenced from anchor-tags, like the following:

[source,html]
----
<a href="file.html">File</a> <!-- <1>-->
---- 
   
    

include::includes/imagemaps.adoc[]
