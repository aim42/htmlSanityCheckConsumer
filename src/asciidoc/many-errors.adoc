[.lead]
This document deliberately contains several (semantic) errors
in the asciidoc source. It shall be used to test the htmlSanityChecker.


[[first]]
== Wrong Cross References


=== Existing and Nonexisting Targets
* item one
* item two

Correct link::
  <<first, goto first>> heading.

Wrong (non-existing) cross-reference::
  points to <<nowhere>>

Existing external link::
  points to https://github.com/aim42


[[only-legal]]
=== Illegal Characters in Cross Reference

It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>, 
like " " (blank) in links.

Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>>

[source,asciidoc]
----
It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>, // <1> 
like " " (blank) in links.

Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>>
----

<1> blank in link source (betwenn "illegal" and "characters")


[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions

. point one
. point two

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicate, this link>> does not know where to take you....


[[duplicateId]]
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicate" id...



== Images

Existing image::
image:aim42-logo.png[aim-logo]

Missing image::
image:nonexisting-image.png[this image deliberately missing]

Missing alt-attribute::
++++
<img src="images/aim42-logo.png" width="100">
++++


== Local Resources
The term "Local Resources" refers to non-image files referenced
from html - most often other html files, stylesheets or JavaScript.

kbd:[htmlSC] currently checks only those local resources which are
referenced from anchor-tags, like the following:

[source,html]
----
<a href="file.html">File</a> <!-- <1>-->
---- 
   
    

include::includes/imagemaps.adoc[]
