[.lead]
This document deliberately contains several (semantic) errors
in the asciidoc source. It shall be used to test the htmlSanityChecker.


[[first]]
== Wrong Internal Links

* item one
* item two

Correct link::
  <<first, goto first>> heading.

Wrong (non-existing) link::
  points to <<nowhere>>

Existing external link::
  points to https://github.com/aim42


=== Background

Html anchor tags contain href attributes, which denote
the link-target (where the browser shall jump when the appropriate
link is clicked).

Example:

[source,html]
----
<a href="missing">missing link</a>

<h1 id="existing">Sample Header</h1>
<a href="existing"> jump to the sample header</a>

----



[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions

. point one
. point two

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicate, this link>> does not know where to take you....


[[duplicateId]]
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicate" id...



== Images

Existing image::
image:aim42-logo.png[aim-logo]

Missing image::
image:nonexisting-image.png[this image deliberately missing]


== Local Resources
The term "Local Resources" refers to non-image files referenced
from html - most often other html files, stylesheets or JavaScript.

kbd:[htmlSC] currently checks only those local resources which are
referenced from anchor-tags, like the following:

[source,html]
----
<a href="file.html">File</a> <!-- <1>-->
----
