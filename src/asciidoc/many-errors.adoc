[.lead]
This document deliberately contains several (semantic) errors
in the asciidoc source. It shall be used to test the htmlSanityChecker.


[[first]]
== Wrong Cross References

=== Existing and Nonexisting Targets


[source,asciidoc]
.Wrong Cross References
----
[[first]]
== Wrong Cross References

=== Existing and Nonexisting Targets

*Correct link*: <<first, goto first>> heading. // <1>

*Wrong (non-existing) cross-reference*: points to <<nowere>> // <2>
----

<1> *Correct link*: <<first, goto first>> heading.

<2> *Wrong (non-existing) cross-reference*: points to <<nowere>>,
link target 'nowhere' does not exist. In such cases, the checker looks
for suggestions.


[[nowhere]]
We have a target names "nowhere" - spelled quite similar
to the "nowere" from above.


[[only-legal]]
=== Illegal Characters in Cross Reference

[source,asciidoc]
.Illegal Characters in Cross Reference
----
It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>, // <1>
like " " (blank) in links.

Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>> // <2>
----

It's a bad idea to include <<illegal characters>>,
like " " (blank) in links.

<1> blank in link source (betwenn "illegal" and "characters")

<2> Better idea: omit <<only-legal, them>>


[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions
This heading has the id "duplicateId"...

[[duplicateId]]
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicateId" ...


[source, asciidoc]
----
[[duplicateId]]
== Duplicate Definitions

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicateId, this link>> // <1>
does not know where to take you....


[[duplicateId]]          // <2>
=== Another Heading, Same id...
This paragraph also has the "duplicate" id...

----

<1> a link to a named HTML element
<2> the duplicate definition of the link target.

Linking to a duplicate definition::
<<duplicateId, this link>> does not know where to take you....




== Images

=== Existing Image
Existing image::
image:aim42-logo.png[aim-logo]

=== Missing Image
In case of missing images, suggestions shall be given:

* If image files are found on the image-path, suggestions are taken from these names
* in case of no images, that fact is reported, but no suggestions are given

Missing image::
The image with filename "nonexisting-image.png" is referenced, but missing.
image:nonexisting-image.png[this image deliberately missing]

==== Suggesting Image File Names
In case we reference a (nonexisting) image, the image directory
shall be scanned for suggestions.

image:hsc-logo-sate.png[missing hsc-logo-sate.png]

Here we reference a file named "hsc-logo-sate.png", in the image directory
we have the following (with the last beeing the best suggestion):

* aim42-logo.png
* hsc-logo-brownish.png
* hsc-logo-light.png
* hsc-logo-shade.png




=== Missing Alt Attribute
This error shall only be reported, no suggestion shall be given.
Missing alt-attribute::
++++
<img src="images/aim42-logo.png" width="100">
++++




== Local Resources
The term "Local Resources" refers to non-image files referenced
from html - most often other html files, stylesheets or JavaScript.

kbd:[htmlSC] currently checks only those local resources which are
referenced from anchor-tags, like the following:

[source,html]
----
<a href="file.html">File</a> <!-- <1>-->
----
