=== Issue Nr 272

These regressions originate from the Randoop tool for generating test cases.

This is a link to https://douglascayers.com/2015/05/30/h[Douglas Cayers] (which should be valid), but has been reported to cause an "unknown host exception" in htmlSanityCheck versions 1.1.0 and below.

Other suspicious links in this context were (taken from the Randoop documentation):
