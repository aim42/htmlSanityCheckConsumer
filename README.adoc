A (dummy) consumer of the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck[htmlSanityCheck] 
Gradle plugin.

Contains a few asciidoc files to show
typical semantic errors in html files 
(which, of course, kbd:[HtmlSC] checker will detect and report).

The explanation of these errors are included from the following file:

----
 ./src/asciidoc/many-errors.adoc

include::./src/asciidoc/many-errors.adoc[tags="html-with-errors"]
