A demo for the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck[htmlSanityCheck] 
Gradle plugin.

Contains a few asciidoc files to show
typical semantic errors in html files 
which kbd:[HtmlSC] checker will detect and report.

[small]#last update {docdate}, build with Asciidoctor {asciidoctor-version}#

toc::[]

== Usage
Checkout from Github, then invoke the following commands:

    gradle htmlSanityCheck

Gradle will download all required libraries, compile the asciidoctor
source files into html and invoke the kbd:[HtmlSC]. You'll find
the checking results in

    build/reports/htmlchecks/index.html
    
    
=== Files Containing Typical Errors

The following file contains loads of semantic errors:
----
 ./src/asciidoc/many-errors.adoc
----
  
Another file is provided, error-free:
----
 ./src/asciidoc/no-errors.adoc
----

== Types of Errors Checked by kbd:[htmlSC]

- [x] <<missing-images, Missing Images>>
- [x] <<broken-cross-references, Broken Cross References>>
- [x] <<missing-local-resources, Missing Local Resources>>
- [ ] Broken External Links
- [x] <<ambiguous-link-targets, Ambiguous Link Targets>>
- [ ] <<broken-image-maps, Broken Image Maps>>
- [x] <<missing-alt-attributes, Missing Alt-Attribute in Image Tags>>


[[missing-images]]
=== Missing Images 
More precisely, kbd:[htmlSC] looks for missing image files on the local
file system, as it currently does NOT support checking of external resources.


[[broken-cross-references]]
=== Broken Cross References
[small]#(synonym: broken internal links)#

Html anchor tags contain href attributes, which denote
the link-target where the browser shall jump when the appropriate
link is clicked.


Example:

[source,html]
----
<a href="missing">missing link</a>  // <1>

<h1 id="existing">Sample Header</h1> // <2>
<a href="existing"> jump to the sample header</a> //<3>
----

<1> This link tells the browser to jump to a location with `id="missing"` (which is missing in this document...)
<2> The `id=...` attribute denotes a specific identification for an HTML element.
<3> This `href`is an existing link target. 



[[missing-local-resoures]]
=== Missing Local Resources
TODO

[[broken-external-links]]
=== Broken External Links
kbd:[HtmlSC] does currently not support external link checking. 
See https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/issues/34[issue #34]


[[ambiguous-link-targets]]
=== Ambiguous Link Targets
TODO


[[broken-image-maps]]
=== Broken ImageMaps
ImageMaps allow parts of an image to be used as hyperlinks to arbitrary targets. 

ImageMaps need two html tags to work: An `<img...>` tag plus a `<map...>` tag.

See the following example for a correct ImageMap (in html source)

[source,html]
----
<img src="image.jpg" usemap="#yourmap"> // <1>

<map name="yourmap"> // <2>
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1,1" href="#test1"> // <3>
  <area shape="circle" coords="0,1,1" href="#test2">
</map>
----

<1> an image (img-tag) with a "usemap" attribute.
<2> the actual map, defining a number of click-sensitive
<3> areas on the image together with the respective link targets.


Several things could go wrong here:

. referenced map does not exist (wrong usemap or wrong map-name)
. several maps exists with same name (ambiguous map-name)
. map not referenced (dangling map)
. no link-targets in map (empty map)
. link-target missing in area (empty href in area)
. broken link targets in map (broken href in area-tag)


[[missing-alt-attributes]]
