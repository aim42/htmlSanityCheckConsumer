A demo for the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck[htmlSanityCheck] 
Gradle plugin.

Contains a few asciidoc files to show
typical semantic errors in html files 
which kbd:[HtmlSC] checker will detect and report.

[small]#last update {docdate}#

toc::[]

== Usage
Checkout from Github, then invoke the following commands:

    gradle htmlSanityCheck

Gradle will download all required libraries, compile the asciidoctor
source files into html and invoke the kbd:[HtmlSC]. You'll find
the checking results in

    build/reports/htmlchecks/index.html
    
    
=== Files Containing Typical Errors

The following file contains loads of semantic errors:
----
 ./src/asciidoc/many-errors.adoc
----
  
Another file is provided, error-free:
----
 ./src/asciidoc/no-errors.adoc
----

[[missing-images]]
=== Missing Images 

[[broken-cross-references]]
=== Broken Cross References

[[missing-local-resoures]]
=== Missing Local Resources

[[broken-external-links]]
=== Broken External Links

[[ambiguous-link-targets]]
=== Ambiguous Link Targets

[[broken-image-maps]]
=== Broken ImageMaps
ImageMaps allow parts of an image to be used as hyperlinks to arbitrary targets. 

ImageMaps need two html tags to work: An `<img...>` tag plus a `<map...>` tag.

See the following example for a correct ImageMap (in html source)

[source,html]
----
<img src="image.jpg" usemap="#yourmap"> // <1>

<map name="yourmap"> // <2>
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1,1" href="#test1"> // <3>
  <area shape="circle" coords="0,1,1" href="#test2">
</map>
----

<1> an image (img-tag) with a "usemap" attribute.
<2> the actual map, defining a number of click-sensitive
<3> areas on the image together with the respective link targets.


Several things could go wrong here:

. referenced map does not exist (wrong usemap or wrong map-name)
. several maps exists with same name (ambiguous map-name)
. map not referenced (dangling map)
. no link-targets in map (empty map)
. link-target missing in area (empty href in area)
. broken link targets in map (broken href in area-tag)
