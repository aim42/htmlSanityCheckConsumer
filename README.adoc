A (dummy) consumer of the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck[htmlSanityCheck] 
Gradle plugin.

Contains a few asciidoc files to show
typical semantic errors in html files 
(which, of course, kbd:[HtmlSC] checker will detect and report).


Current version 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT, last update {docdate}
Released version 0.5.3.


== Usage
Checkout from Github, then invoke the following commands:

    gradle htmlSanityCheck

Gradle will download all required libraries, compile the asciidoctor
source files into html and invoke the kbd:[HtmlSC] itself. You'll find
the checking results in

    build/reports/htmlchecks/index.html
    
    
== File Containing Many Errors
----
 ./src/asciidoc/many-errors.adoc
----
  
(Github does not allow file-includes in this readme, therefore you currently
have to look at that file to get the explanation...)
